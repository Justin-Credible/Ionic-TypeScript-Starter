--- # Build Schemes

# The name of the scheme to use if one isn't provided via the --scheme flag.
default: "localdev"

# This holds a collection of data that can be used to override and/or supplement existing
# scheme replacement collections. These values will stomp over values from a scheme when
# used. These can be used by appending the name on to an existing scheme with a comma.
# For Example: gulp config --scheme development,web
overrides:
    web:
        IS_WEB_PLATFORM: true

# Different build schemes used by "gulp config --scheme scheme_name".
# These are used to set the debug flag and perform variable replacement on other files.
schemes:
    # A common/base scheme for names, versions, etc.
    # Not to be used directly; should be used as a base for all other schemes.
