Its focus on looking and performing like a native app was icing on the cake.\n\n\nAround the same time I discovered Ionic, I also learning \nTypeScript\n for refactoring large enterprise applications. After seeing the power of TypeScript's code insight for rich IDE tooling and compile time checking, I never wanted to go back to vanilla JavaScript.\n\n\nI had been wanted to get into mobile app development for a while, and Ionic and TypeScript, coupled with the free \nVisual Studio Code\n IDE made this an attrictive solution for cross platform development.\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere to Start?\n\n\nThe starter project template targets iOS, Android, and Chrome (as an extension). Development can be done on Mac OS, Linux, or Windows with your favorite IDE or text editor. I recommend using the free and lightweight \nVisual Studio Code\n editor as it has superb support for TypeScript. This project also includes VS Code task mappings to the various gulp tasks.\n\n\nTo begin, take look at \nGetting Started\n for information on pre-requisites and instructions on how to setup your development environment.\n\n\nNext, I recommend examining the project layout and \nGulp Tasks\n.\n\n\nFinally, you can learn about the functionality that is included with the \nBase Framework\n and get some \nDevelopment Tips\n.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you are developing on Windows or Linux and intend to create iOS builds, you'll want to check out \nRunning iOS Simulator Remotely\n for more details on how to use a remote OS X machine to create your iOS builds.\n\n\n\n\nWhy?\n\n\nI put this starter project together as a result of looking for examples on how to use TypeScript with an Ionic/Angular application. There were several simple code snippets and examples out there, but nothing that showed how to structure an entire mobile application.\n\n\nIn addition, most examples I found didn't really take full advantage of TypeScript in my opinion. I wanted to explore what a well structured mobile application could look like and avoid the deeply nested annonymous JavaScript functions pattern I commonly ran across.\n\n\nMy goal is a clean and easy to read codebase that should be intuitive for anyone to get started with, even those without much Ionic or Angular experience.\n\n\n\"Framework\" vs \"Starter Project\"\n\n\nMy intention here is not to create a complete application framework, but instead provide an example of how you can structure your Ionic application using TypeScript.\n\n\nThe distinction here is that you won't download a ZIP file or drop in a pre-built library to your application to use this project. Instead, this project is a reference or starting point for your own application.\n\n\nWhile there is some framework-like functionality included (base controller classes, dialog helpers, utility classes, etc) it is all optional and can be used (or omitted!) at your own discretion. See \nBase Framework\n for more details on what is included.\n\n\nAlso, I suggest restructuring the application to fit your needs. Don't like gulp? Switch to your favorite task runner.

This includes base classes as well as the second level boot loader.\n\n\nsrc/Framework/Boot2.ts\n\n\nThis is the second level boot loader whose purpose is to initialize Angular and Ionic. This involves declaring the root Angular module as well as registering Angular components (such as controllers, services, directives, and filters). This is where the Angular run and config functions live.\n\n\nThe second level boot loader's \nboot()\n method is invoked from the first level boot loader (\nwww/js/boot1.js\n). After it finishes, it then delegates to the \nstart()\n method in the \nsrc/Application/Application.ts\n file.\n\n\nFramework/BootHelper.ts\n\n\nThis contains helper methods for use by the second level boot loader such as controller or service registration etc.\n\n\nFramework/BaseController.ts\n\n\nThis is a base class that should be used by all of the Angular controllers.\n\n\nSee \nBase Framework: Controllers\n for more information.\n\n\nFramework/BaseDialogController.ts\n\n\nThis is a base class that should be used by all of the Angular controllers used for Ionic modal dialogs.\n\n\nSee \nBase Framework: Dialogs\n for more information.\n\n\nFramework/BaseElementDirective.ts\n\n\nThis is a base class that should be used by all of the Angular directives that are for elements.\n\n\nSee \nBase Framework: Directives\n for more information.\n\n\nFramework/DialogOptions.ts\n\n\nThis is an model object used to pass data and set options for Ionic modal dialogs.\n\n\nSee \nBase Framework: Dialogs\n for more information.\n\n\nFramework/EmptyViewModel.ts\n\n\nThis is an empty view model class used for controllers that do not need a view model.\n\n\nApplication\n\n\nThe application directory contains code specific to your application that is not tied to specific views.\n\n\nApplication/Application.ts\n\n\nThis contains the main class for your application. Its \nstart()\n method is invoked by the second level boot loader.\n\n\nHere you can subscribe to device events (eg pause, resume) or configure Cordova plugins when your application starts.\n\n\nThis is a good place to put logic that doesn't correspond to any of your view specifically. For example, exception handlers or push notification handlers.\n\n\nThis project uses the \ndevice_resume\n method to determine the initial view the user should be placed on.\n\n\nApplication/Constants.ts\n\n\nThis file contains a static namespace housing constants for use throughout your application.\n\n\nApplication/RouteConfig.ts\n\n\nThis file contains a single, static method named \nsetupRoutes(...)\n which is delegated to from the second level boot loader.\n\n\nIt is responsible for defining up all of the Angular routes by specifying the controller and view to use for each route.\n\n\nFilters\n\n\nThis is where all of your \nAngular filters\n should live.\n\n\nAn example filter is provided with the sample project. A filter should be a class with a static \nfilter\n method.\n\n\nSee \nBase Framework: Filters\n for more details.\n\n\nDirectives\n\n\nThis is where all of your \nAngular directives\n should live.\n\n\nTwo example directives are provided with the sample project; one is a simple directive (extending \nng.IDirective\n) and one is an element directive (extending \nBaseElementDirective\n).\n\n\nSee \nBase Framework: Directives\n for more details.\n\n\nModels\n\n\nThis is where you can store model objects that are shared across multiple areas or services in your application (not view models, for example).\n\n\nServices\n\n\nThis is where all of your \nAngular services\n sholud live.\n\n\nThere are several services provided with the sample project; see \nBase Framework: Services\n for more details.\n\n\nStyles\n\n\nThis is where you should store your common or shared SASS styles. The \nIndex.scss\n file is used to reference all of the SASS files to be compiled.\n\n\nStyles that are specific to a view should be co-located in the appropriate view directory.\n\n\nSee \ngulp sass\n in \nGulp Tasks\n for more details.\n\n\nViews\n\n\nThis directory should contain all of your controllers, view models, templates, and styles for each view.\n\n\nThe default layout uses a directory for each view which contains its controller, view model, template and styling.\n\n\nEach controller should extend \nBaseController\n or \nBaseDialogController\n.\n\n\nSee \ngulp templates\n and \ngulp sass\n in \nGulp Tasks\n and \nBase Framework: Views\n for more details.",

The tasks are located in \ngulpfile.js\n and are executed from the project directory using the \ngulp task_name\n command.\n\n\nCompilation Tasks\n\n\nThe following tasks can be used to perform code configuration, library and plugin setup, and TypeScript compilation.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you are using VSCode, you can use \n\u2318 Command\n\u21e7 Shift\nR\n and being typing the name of the task your want to run. See \n.vscode/tasks.config\n for more task shortcuts.\n\n\n\n\ngulp init\n\n\nThe init task is used to initialize the Cordova project by adding platforms, plugins, obtaining third party libraries, and performing TypeScript compilation.\n\n\nFirst, it cleans the environment by running several gulp clean tasks. This will result in several generated directories and files being removed.\n\n\nNext, it adds Cordova platforms by running the \ncordova platform add platform_name\n command for each of the platforms as defined in \npackage.json\n.\n\n\nThen it delegates to the config and default gulp tasks which handle configuration, adding Cordova plugins, obtaining Bower libraries and compiling templates, SASS, and TypeScript.\n\n\nFinally, this task can perform custom initialization based on a \nprep\n flag. For example, when using \ngulp init --prep android\n all of the above is performed as well as adding the \nCrossWalk\n plugin for Android. You can customize this task to perform special behavior per platform if needed.\n\n\nIn addition to initializing your environment for first use, this task is also useful for cleaning up your environment if you run into issues during development.\n\n\ngulp config\n\n\nThe config task is used to perform customization of configuration files based on the given build scheme name. Build schemes are defined in \nconfig.master.xml\n under the \nschemes\n node. If a scheme name is not specified, the default will be used.\n\n\nThis task takes care of creating the following files:\n\n\n\n\nCordova's \nconfig.xml\n (from \nconfig.master.xml\n)\n\n\nStarting page \nwww/index.html\n (from \nwww/index.master.html\n)\n\n\nRuntime variables at \nsrc/js/build-vars.js\n\n\n\n\nThese files will be generated from their master files and variable substitution will be performed based on the scheme definitions. This allows for easy configuration of builds for different environments (ie development, staging, production).\n\n\nExample Usage: \ngulp config --scheme production\n\n\nSee \nDevelopment Tips: Build Schemes\n for more details.\n\n\ngulp templates\n\n\nThe templates task compiles Angular HTML templates from \nsrc/Views/**/*.html\n into a single JavaScript file at \nwww/js/templates.js\n.\n\n\nYou'll need to re-run this task to see any HTML template changes during development.\n\n\ngulp sass\n\n\nThe sass task compiles the SASS source files starting with \nsrc/Styles/Index.scss\n. The resulting CSS bundle will be output to \nwww/css/bundle.css\n.\n\n\nYou'll need to re-run this task to see any SASS styling changes during development.\n\n\nThe SASS output will be minified if the debug flag is set to true via the current build scheme.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you run this task from VS Code, SASS problems will be shown in VS Code's error console.\n\n\n\n\ngulp libs\n\n\nThe libs task uses the \nBower\n package manager and \nbower-installer\n plugin to download JavaScript libraries for use within your application.\n\n\nInitially, Bower will download the files to the \nbower_components\n directory and the \nbower-installer\n plugin will take care of copying the appropriate files to the \nwww/lib\n directory.\n\n\nSee \nbower.json\n for more details (as well as for if you need to change which files get copied to the libs directory).\n\n\ngulp plugins\n\n\nThe plugins task is used to install all of the Cordova plugins as defined in \npackage.json\n's \ncordovaPlugins\n property.\n\n\nThis task is simply a shortcut for running \ncordova plugin add plugin_name\n for each of the plugins.\n\n\ngulp tsd\n\n\nThe tsd task is used to download and setup TypeScript definition files for JavaScript libraries so they can be referenced from TypeScript source files. The \ntsd\n tool uses the \nDefinitelyTyped\n repository.\n\n\nThe \ntsd.json\n and \ntsd.tests.json\n files are used to specify the typing files to download for the application and unit tests respectively.\n\n\nAfter downloading the definitions, the \ntsd\n tool will generate a reference file at \nsrc/tsd.d.ts\n (or \ntests/tsd.d.ts\n for unit tests) that the TypeScript compiler will read during compilation.\n\n\ngulp ts\n\n\nThe ts task is used to perform compilation of the TypeScript using configuration from \nsrc/tsconfig.json\n.\n\n\nThe resulting JavaScript bundle will be written to \nwww/js/bundle.js\n.\n\n\nThe JavaScript output will be minifed if the debug flag is set to true via the current build scheme. Minification is done by delegating to the minify task.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you are using VS Code, you can use \n\u2318 Command\n\u21e7 Shift\nB\n to run the \nts\n task with the default scheme. Any compilation problems will be shown in VS Code's error console.\n\n\n\n\ngulp minify\n\n\nThe minify task will minify the JavaScript bundle at \nsrc/js/bundle.js\n.\n\n\nThis task can be run directly, but can be delegated to via the ts task as well.\n\n\ngulp lint\n\n\nThe lint task performs \nlinting\n of the TypeScript source files.\n\n\nLint parameters are defined in \ntslint.json\n.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you run this task from VS Code lint problems will be shown in VS Code's warning console.\n\n\n\n\ngulp chrome\n\n\nThe chrome task is used to generate a \nchrome\n directory with your application that can be loaded as a Chrome extension.\n\n\nUtility Tasks\n\n\nThe following tasks can be used to perform various tasks that aren't necessarily related to compilation.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you are using VS Code, you can use \n\u2318 Command\n\u21e7 Shift\n \nR\n and being typing the name of the task your want to run. See \n.vscode/tasks.config\n for more task shortcuts.\n\n\n\n\ngulp watch\n\n\nThis task is used internally via Ionic's serve command (\nionic serve\n). This allows Ionic to reload the web browser when the specified files change during development.\n\n\ngulp emulate-ios\n\n\nThis task is a shortcut for \ncordova emulate ios\n which is a useful shortcut to use from VS Code's task runner.\n\n\ngulp emulate-android\n\n\nThis task is a shortcut for \ncordova emulate android\n which is a useful shortcut to use from VS Code's task runner.\n\n\ngulp remote-emulate-ios\n\n\nThis task allows Windows or Linux developers to run the iOS simulator on a remote Mac OS X computer.\n\n\nSee \nDevelopment Tips: Running iOS Simulator from Windows\n for more details.\n\n\ngulp test\n\n\nThe test task is used to compile the TypeScript unit tests and run them via the Karma test runner. See \nkarma.conf.js\n for Karma configuration.\n\n\nSee \nUnit Testing\n for more details on unit tests.\n\n\ngulp typedoc\n\n\nThe typedoc task uses \nTypeDoc\n to generate documentation for the TypeScript source code.\n\n\nThe documentation files are output to \ntypedoc-output\n.\n\n\ngulp clean\n\n\nThe clean task is used to remove all of the generated files, included the \nnode_modules\n directory.\n\n\nIf you don't want to remove everything, there are subtasks for each of the gulp tasks to clean specific artifacts. For example: \ngulp clean:ts\n or \ngulp clean:plugins\n.\n\n\nAfter cleaning, you may need to re-run \ngulp init\n to ensure your environment is re-initialized.",

This section will cover its features.\n\n\nIt is important to note that this starter project is not actually a framework. See \nFramework vs Starter Project\n for the distinction.\n\n\nThe base namespace used is \nJustinCredible.SampleApp\n. To switch this to your own namespace you can perform a project find and replace.\n\n\nBuild Schemes\n\n\nThe project is setup so that builds can be made for different environments. This is useful for easily switching between development, staging, or production environments for example.\n\n\nYou can switch between build schemes using the \ngulp config --scheme scheme_name\n command.\n\n\nSee \nDevelopment Tips: Build Schemes\n for more details.\n\n\nBoot Sequence\n\n\nCordova uses the the \nsrc\n attribute of the content element from \nconfig.xml\n to determine the initial page to load, which is set to \nindex.html\n by default.\n\n\nThe \nindex.html\n file has static references to all of the CSS and JavaScript files to load. In addition to the main application bundle (\nwww/js/bundle.js\n) the page also references the first level boot loader: \nwww/js/boot1.js\n. This file is responsible for executing any code before Cordova's JS API, Ionic, or Angular have been initialized. It then kicks off the second level boot loader by invoking \nJustinCredible.SampleApp.Boot2.main()\n.\n\n\nThe second level boot loader is located at \nsrc/Framework/Boot2.ts\n (which is compiled into \nwww/js/bundle.js\n). The second level boot loader is responsible for initializing Ionic after the Cordova JavaScript ready event occurs. This is where you would configure Angular services and modules.\n\n\nThe second level boot loader takes care of registering filters, directives, controllers, and services automatically using a helper (\nsrc/Framework/BootHelper.ts\n). It does so by examining the applicable namespaces (eg \nJustinCredible.SampleApp.Filters\n, \nJustinCredible.SampleApp.Services\n, etc). More details are provided in the applicable sections. The second level boot loader also takes care of setting up the Angular routes using the \nsrc/Application/RouteConfig.ts\n file.\n\n\nAfter initializing and configuring Angular, the second level boot loader then delegates to the \nstart()\n method of the application service located in \nsrc/Application/Application.ts\n.\n\n\nThe application service is where the bulk of your low-level application specific code should be located (ie device events, global event handlers, push notification handlers etc). It takes care of pushing the user to the initial view.\n\n\nViews\n\n\nA view or screen in your application will consist of an HTML Angular template, an Angular controller, a view model, and optionally, CSS styling.\n\n\nA view is registered in the \nsrc/Application/RouteConfig.ts\n file by specifying the path to its template, the ID of its controller, and its URL and state name:\n\n\n// A shared view used between categories, assigned a number via the route URL (categoryNumber).\n$stateProvider.state(\napp.category\n, {\n    url: \n/category/:categoryNumber\n,\n    views: {\n        \nroot-view\n: {\n            templateUrl: \nViews/Category/Category.html\n,\n            controller: Controllers.CategoryController.ID\n        }\n    }\n});\n\n\n\n\nIn most simple Angular examples you'll find that templates, controllers, and view models are often located in seperate directories. While this is nice for a simple application, in larger applications it is burden to track down each of the files. This starter project instead groups the files by feature rather than function.\n\n\nFor example, you'll find all of the files applicable to the category view located at \nsrc/Views/Category\n:\n\n\n\n\nControllers\n\n\nEvery controller in your application should extend the provided \nBaseController\n class and specify the type of view model for the view:\n\n\nnamespace JustinCredible.SampleApp.Controllers {\n\n    export class CategoryController extends BaseController\nViewModels.CategoryViewModel\n {\n\n        //#region Injection\n\n        public static ID = \nCategoryController\n;\n\n        public static get $inject(): string[] {\n            return [\n                \n$scope\n,\n                \n$stateParams\n\n                Services.Utilities.ID\n            ];\n        }\n\n        constructor(\n            $scope: ng.IScope,\n            private $stateParams: ICategoryStateParams,\n            private Utilities: Services.Utilities) {\n            super($scope, ViewModels.CategoryViewModel);\n        }\n\n        //#endregion\n\n        //#region BaseController Events\n\n        protected view_beforeEnter(event?: ng.IAngularEvent, eventArgs?: Ionic.IViewEventArguments): void {\n            super.view_beforeEnter(event, eventArgs);\n\n            // Set the category number into the view model using the value as provided\n            // in the view route (via the $stateParameters).\n            let label = this.Utilities.format(\nCategory: {0}\n, this.$stateParams.categoryNumber);\n            this.viewModel.categoryLabel = label;\n        }\n\n        //#endregion\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf your view does not have a view model you can use the provided \nEmptyViewModel\n class.\n\n\n\n\nThe services to be injected into the controller are controlled via the static \n$inject\n property. These IDs are used to located the services to be injected into the contructor.\n\n\nThe constructor receives these parameters and can save off the services to the local instance. TypeScript allows the \nprivate\n keyword in the constructor to indicate that the parameters should be accessible as private instance variables.\n\n\nAnd finally, the base events avaiable from the \nBaseController\n can be overridden. These include several events exposed by Ionic:\n\n\n\n\nview_loaded\n\n\nview_enter\n\n\nview_leave\n\n\nview_beforeEnter\n\n\nview_beforeLeave\n\n\nview_afterEnter\n\n\nview_afterLeave\n\n\nview_unloaded\n\n\ndestroy\n\n\n\n\nView Model\n\n\nThe view model specified is accessible in the template via the \nviewModel\n property:\n\n\nion-view view-title=\nCategory {{viewModel.categoryNumber}}\n\n\n\n\n\nView Events\n\n\nTo access an event on your controller, you should make your event \nprotected\n:\n\n\nprotected button1_click(event: ng.IAngularEvent): void {\n   ...\n}\n\n\n\n\nand access them using the \ncontroller\n property:\n\n\nbutton ng-click=\ncontroller.button1_click($event)\nClick Me!\n/button\n\n\n\n\n\nDirectives\n\n\nAngular directives are located in the \nsrc/Directives\n directory. There are two types of directives in this starter project; standard and element instance directives.\n\n\nStandard Directive\n\n\nA standard directive is simply a class that has a link function.\n\n\nAn example of a standard directive can be found in \nsrc/Directives/OnLoadDirective.ts\n. This directive can be used by placing an \non-load\n attribute on an image element and will cause a function to be fired when the image has loaded. For example:\n\n\nimg src=\n...\n on-load=\ncontroller.image1_load()\n\n\n\n\n\nElement Instance Directive\n\n\nThe optional \nBaseElementDirective\n class provides a recommendation on how to build element directives. This base class provides an \ninitialize\n and \nrender\n methods which should be overridden in your implementation.\n\n\nBuild element directives with this base class is useful for elements that need to maintain state, fire events, or otherwise act as accessible instances from your controller.\n\n\nAn example directive that can be used to show an icon with text is located at \n/src/Directives/Icon-Panel/IconPanelDirective.ts\n and is used from the category controller.\n\n\nFilters\n\n\nAngular filters are located in the \nsrc/Filters\n directory. To be registered as a filter, its class should exist the \nJustinCredible.SampleApp.Filters\n namespace.

In a non-debug build, they can also be enabled by tapping the application icon in the About view ten times.\n\n\nThis view is a good location for items that are used during development. By default it allows the user to toggle mock HTTP mode, test various plugins, view logs logged by the Logger service, and view device information.\n\n\nDialogs\n\n\nIonic provides the \n$ionicModal\n service which can be used to show modal dialogs. This sample project includes the \nBaseDialogController\n base class and a \nUiHelper\n method \nshowDialog()\n which are used to simplify usage and normalize dialog behavior.\n\n\nTwo example dialogs are included with this sample project and are located at \nsrc/Views/Dialogs\n.\n\n\nThe \nshowDialog\n method wraps Ionic's modal implementation. It should be invoked with the ID of the controller for the dialog and optional dialog options. It returns a promise that is resolved once the dialog has been closed.\n\n\nthis.UiHelper.showDialog(PinEntryController.ID, options)\n    .then((result: Models.PinEntryDialogResultModel) =\n {\n\n    // Dialog closed with result object.\n});\n\n\n\n\nTo create a dialog you first need to create a template with the modal class and the \nng-controller\n attribute to specify the ID of your dialog's controller:\n\n\ndiv class=\nmodal\n ng-controller=\nPinEntryController\n\n\n\n\n\nThen you'll need to create a controller that extends \nBaseDialogController\n. If you examine the base class you'll see that it requires three templated types:\n\n\nexport class BaseDialogController\nV, D, R\n extends BaseController\nV\n { ... }\n\n\n\n\n\n\nV\n - view model that will be used in the dialog's template and controller.\n\n\nD\n - dialog model that is passed into the dialog via the options parameters when opening the dialog.\n\n\nR\n - dialog result model that is used to return information from the dialog to the caller promise when the dialog is closed.\n\n\n\n\nFor example, the PIN entry dialog itself works with \nPinEntryViewModel\n (\nV\n). It receives \nPinEntryDialogModel\n as its input (\nD\n) and when it closes it returns \nPinEntryDialogResultModel\n (\nR\n):\n\n\nexport class PinEntryController\n    extends BaseDialogController\nViewModels.PinEntryViewModel, Models.PinEntryDialogModel, Models.PinEntryDialogResultModel\n {\n    ...\n}   \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nEach of these types are optional, and not all dialogs will require all three types. For any types you do not wish to specify you can pass \nany\n or \nViewModels.EmptyViewModel\n.\n\n\n\n\nIf you examine the sample dialogs you'll see that the base class provides two events that are fired when the dialog opens and closes (\ndialog_shown\n and \ndialog_hidden\n respectively).\n\n\nAlso there are two base helper methods provided. The first, \ngetData()\n, is used to obtain the model object that was used to open the dialog (templated type \nD\n). The second \nclose()\n used to close the dialog. You can optionally pass an object of type \nR\n to the close method which will be returned to the opener via the promise result.\n\n\nPopovers\n\n\nWhile this starter project does not contain a specific base class for Ionic's popover view, you can see an example of one being used on Develper Tools \n Logs view.\n\n\nA popover is generally initialized via the \nview_beforeEnter\n event by specifying the path to an HTML template and scope to use (which can be the same scope as the current controller). The popover can later be shown by invoking its \nshow()\n method:\n\n\nprotected view_beforeEnter(event?: ng.IAngularEvent, eventArgs?: Ionic.IViewEventArguments): void {\n    super.view_beforeEnter(event, eventArgs);\n\n    this.$ionicPopover.fromTemplateUrl(\nViews/Settings/Logs-List/Log-Filter-Menu.html\n, {\n        scope: this.scope\n    }).then((popover: any) =\n {\n        this._popover = popover;\n    });\n}\n\nprotected filter_click(event: ng.IAngularEvent) {\n    this._popover.show(event);\n}\n\n\n\n\nIf the popover is sharing the same scope, the view model and controller can be accessed in the same way as a \nstandard controller\n by using the \nviewModel\n and \ncontroller\n keywords.",

In addition to the main application bundle ( www/js/bundle.js ) the page also references the first level boot loader:  www/js/boot1.js . This file is responsible for executing any code before Cordova's JS API, Ionic, or Angular have been initialized. It then kicks off the second level boot loader by invoking  JustinCredible.SampleApp.Boot2.main() .  The second level boot loader is located at  src/Framework/Boot2.ts  (which is compiled into  www/js/bundle.js ). The second level boot loader is responsible for initializing Ionic after the Cordova JavaScript ready event occurs. This is where you would configure Angular services and modules.  The second level boot loader takes care of registering filters, directives, controllers, and services automatically using a helper ( src/Framework/BootHelper.ts ). It does so by examining the applicable namespaces (eg  JustinCredible.SampleApp.Filters ,  JustinCredible.SampleApp.Services , etc). More details are provided in the applicable sections. The second level boot loader also takes care of setting up the Angular routes using the  src/Application/RouteConfig.ts  file.  After initializing and configuring Angular, the second level boot loader then delegates to the  start()  method of the application service located in  src/Application/Application.ts .

D  - dialog model that is passed into the dialog via the options parameters when opening the dialog.  R  - dialog result model that is used to return information from the dialog to the caller promise when the dialog is closed.   For example, the PIN entry dialog itself works with  PinEntryViewModel  ( V ). It receives  PinEntryDialogModel  as its input ( D ) and when it closes it returns  PinEntryDialogResultModel  ( R ):  export class PinEntryController\n    extends BaseDialogController ViewModels.PinEntryViewModel, Models.PinEntryDialogModel, Models.PinEntryDialogResultModel  {\n    ...\n}      Note  Each of these types are optional, and not all dialogs will require all three types. For any types you do not wish to specify you can pass  any  or  ViewModels.EmptyViewModel .   If you examine the sample dialogs you'll see that the base class provides two events that are fired when the dialog opens and closes ( dialog_shown  and  dialog_hidden  respectively).  Also there are two base helper methods provided. The first,  getData() , is used to obtain the model object that was used to open the dialog (templated type  D ). The second  close()  used to close the dialog. You can optionally pass an object of type  R  to the close method which will be returned to the opener via the promise result.",

            "text": "Overview\n\n\nThis section contains a list of tips and suggestions I've found useful when building mobile apps with this sample project.\n\n\nDeveloping with Chrome\n\n\nChrome offers excellent support for debugging TypeScript as well as working with mobile applications. The developer tools provide user agent string spoofing, view port emulation, network speed throttling and more.\n\n\nIonic offers the \nionic serve\n command which starts a lightweight HTTP server and serves your application.\n\n\nWith these two features combined your can rapidly build out your application without lengthy native compilation or emulator startup times.\n\n\n\n\nSecurity Flags\n\n\nWhen making HTTP requests to your backend API during development, you may find it useful to disable several security features such as the same origin policy and SSL certificate checking. To do so, you can start Chrome using the following flags:\n\n\n# OS X\n$ open -a \nGoogle Chrome.app\n --ignore-certificate-errors --disable-web-security\n\n# Windows\n\n chrome.exe --ignore-certificate-errors --disable-web-security\n\n\n\n\nSince these flags disable important security features, it is important that you do not use this Chrome instance for normal web browsing. If you use Chrome as your primary browser, I recommend launching a second instance pointed at a development only profile:\n\n\n# OS X\n$ open -a \nGoogle Chrome.app\n --ignore-certificate-errors --disable-web-security --user-data-dir=/tmp/ChromeDev\n\n# Windows\n\n chrome.exe --ignore-certificate-errors --disable-web-security --user-data-dir=C:\\tmp\\ChromeDev\n\n\n\n\nI went a step further and created an AppleScript which allows me to interactively start a new Chrome instance based on a series of dialog prompts to enable optional features like proxies. You can read more \nhere\n or look at the script directly \nhere\n.\n\n\nMock Platform APIs\n\n\nWhen you are running your application in Chrome you will be unable to call Cordova plugins that do not provide a brower platform implementation.\n\n\nIn this case you'll need to mock up the plugin's API interface via \nsrc/Framework/MockPlatformApis.ts\n.\n\n\nThe pattern I follow is to have all plugin access go through the \nPlugins\n service. This service exposes a property for each plugin. The property accessor should check to see if the plugin is available, and if it isn't, delegate to a mock implementation.\n\n\nYour mock implementation can simply be a no-op, or you can write a simple polyfill to provide basic funtionalilty for testing.\n\n\nYou'll see that the sample project uses the Cordova notification plugin to display native alert and confirm dialogs while running on devices. But when running in a browser, a mock implementation is provided that delegates to Ionic's   \n$ionicPopup\n service.\n\n\nMock HTTP APIs\n\n\nDuring development you may find it useful to mock up the responses for HTTP requests. This can be useful to test edge cases in your application or even build an application against APIs that aren't yet live.\n\n\nYou can mock up HTTP responses in \nsrc/Framework/MockHttpApis.ts\n. First, you specify the regular expression to match against a request URL, and then you provide a method which returns the data for that request.\n\n\nWhen mock HTTP API mode is enabled (via the \nin-app developer tools\n) these requests will not go over the wire and will instead return your mocked up data. There is a randomized delay of between one to three seconds so that you can simulate the latency of a request on a cellular network.\n\n\nRunning Natively\n\n\nTo run your application on the iOS Simulator or Android emulator you can use the \nionic emulate ios\n or \nionic emulate android\n commands respectively.\n\n\nLikewise, to run on an attached device, you can use the \nionic run ios --device\n or \nionic run android --device\n commands.\n\n\nIt is important to remember that part of what Cordova does for you is generating the native projects in the platforms directory. These native projects can be opened in XCode and Android Studio. This is useful for debugging native code plugins. To update the generated projects you can run \nionic prepare ios\n or \nionic prepare android\n.\n\n\nRunning iOS Simulator Remotely\n\n\nIf you are developing your application on a Windows or Linux machine, but want to test and run your application on iOS, you can do so using the \ngulp remote-emulate-ios\n task to target a remote OS X machine.\n\n\nFirst, you'll need to install the \nremotebuild\n package via npm on the OS X machine on which you want to build the project and run the simulator. Note that since the Cordova project will be built on the OS X machine, you'll need to make sure you have all the build prerequisites installed (Xcode etc).\n\n\n$ npm install -g remotebuild\n$ remotebuild start\n\n\n\n\nNext, you'll want to edit \nremote-build.json\n located in the root of the starter project. This file will let you set the host name, port, and URL to point at your OS X machine, as well as configure other settings.\n\n\nFinally, you can execute \ngulp remote-emulate-ios\n from the root of the starter project which will take care of TypeScript compilation, building a payload, and uploading it to the OS X machine so it can be built.\n\n\nVisual Studio Code\n\n\nShortcuts\n\n\nIf you are usig VSCode, you can use \n\u2318 Command\n\u21e7 Shift\nB\n to build the application. This will execute the \ngulp ts\n task.\n\n\nAdditionally, you can use \n\u2318 Command\n\u21e7 Shift\nR\n and then begin typing the name of a gulp task to run.\n\n\n\n\nTasks\n\n\nThe \n.vscode/tasks.json\n file contains configuration for the tasks you can launch, as well as definition for the problem matchers. A problem matcher allows you to define a regular expression which matches console output from a task and then use that information to display warnings or errors in Visual Studio Code's warning or error views.\n\n\n\n\nBuild Schemes\n\n\nDuring development it is a common requirement to be able to be able to create different builds of your application. For example, you may have a development build used by developers while writing code, a staging environment for QA staff to test changes, and a production environment for live users.\n\n\nIn each of these schemes you may need to point at different API URLs or use different Google Analytics accounts for example.\n\n\nThe starter project offers a gulp task and XML configuration to make it easy to switch between environments.\n\n\nConfiguration Task\n\n\nThe \ngulp config\n task is responsible for configuring the application for the default scheme. If a scheme name is provided via the scheme argument that scheme's configuration will be used instead.\n\n\nFor example, to use a scheme named staging:\n\n\ngulp config --scheme staging\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe \ngulp ts\n task first runs \ngulp config\n so that if you are using VS Code, pressing \n\u2318 Command\n\u21e7 Shift\nB\n will result in the app being configured for the default scheme in addition to compiling TypeScript code.\n\n\n\n\nScheme Definitions\n\n\nBuild schemes are defined in the \nconfig.master.xml\n as child nodes under the \nschemes\n node:\n\n\nschemes default=\ndevelopment\n\n\n  \nscheme name=\ndevelopment\n debug=\ntrue\n\n    \nreplacement target=\nAPI_URL\n value=\nhttp://development.your-company.com/api\n/\n\n    \nreplacement target=\nAPI_VERSION\n value=\nv1\n/\n\n  \n/scheme\n\n\n  \nscheme name=\nstaging\n debug=\ntrue\n\n    \nreplacement target=\nAPI_URL\n value=\nhttp://development.your-company.com/api\n/\n\n    \nreplacement target=\nAPI_VERSION\n value=\nv1\n/\n\n  \n/scheme\n\n\n  \nscheme name=\nproduction\n debug=\nfalse\n\n    \nreplacement target=\nAPI_URL\n value=\nhttp://www.your-company.com/api\n/\n\n    \nreplacement target=\nAPI_VERSION\n value=\nv1\n/\n\n  \n/scheme\n\n\n\n/schemes\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \ndefault\n attribute indicates the name of the scheme to use if one isn't provided when executing \ngulp config\n (or using the VS Code shortcut).\n\n\nEach scheme has a \nname\n attribute as well as a \ndebug\n attribute. The debug attribute sets the value of an arbitrary debug flag that is available at application runtime. This flag can be checked to perform different behavior based on the flag's value (eg \nUtilities.isDebugMode\n).\n\n\nUnder each scheme node are replacement nodes. The \nvalue\n attribute is the content that should be used to replace any occurances of the value of the \ntarget\n attribute. Replacements will occur in the files listed in the generated files section.\n\n\nFor example, using the staging scheme by running \ngulp config --scheme staging\n would result in following configuration chunk from \nconfig.master.xml\n:\n\n\npreference name=\napiUrl\n value=\n${API_URL}\n/\n\n\npreference name=\napiVersion\n value=\n${API_VERSION}\n/\n\n\n\n\n\nbeing replaced with the following output to \nconfig.xml\n:\n\n\npreference name=\napiUrl\n value=\nhttp://development.your-company.com/api\n/\n\n\npreference name=\napiVersion\n value=\nv1\n/\n\n\n\n\n\nBase Schemes\n\n\nSome of your build schemes may have near identical configuration save for a single value or two. For these cases you can create a base scheme that contains the common values, and a specific scheme that uses the base scheme.\n\n\nFor example, perhaps you have two schemes that both point at production, but one is for pre-release testing in which you don't want analytics tracking enabled:\n\n\nscheme name=\nbase\n\n  \nreplacement target=\nAPI_URL\n value=\nhttp://app.company.com/api\n/\n\n  \nreplacement target=\nAPI_VERSION\n value=\nv1\n/\n\n\n/scheme\n\n\n\nscheme name=\nprerelease\n debug=\ntrue\n base-scheme=\nbase\n\n  \nreplacement target=\nGoogleAnalyticsId\n value=\n/\n\n\n/scheme\n\n\n\nscheme name=\nrelease\n debug=\nfalse\n base-scheme=\nbase\n\n  \nreplacement target=\nGoogleAnalyticsId\n value=\n1234567890\n/\n\n\n/scheme\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerated Files\n\n\nThe \ngulp config\n task takes care of generating the following files:\n\n\n\n\nCordova's \nconfig.xml\n (from \nconfig.master.xml\n)\n\n\nStarting page \nwww/index.html\n (from \nwww/index.master.html\n)\n\n\nRuntime variables at \nsrc/js/build-vars.js\n\n\n\n\nThe \nconfig.xml\n and \nwww/index.html\n files will have had variable substitution performed based on the build scheme.\n\n\nThe \nbuild-vars.js\n file will contain information about the build such as application name, version number, debug flag, and build timestamp. In addition, all of the \npreference\n elements' values from \nconfig.xml\n will be present in a properties collection. All of these values are available via the \nConfiguration\n service.",
