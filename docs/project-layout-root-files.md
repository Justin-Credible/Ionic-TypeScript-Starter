See `gulp libs` in [Gulp Tasks](gulp-tasks.md#gulp-libs) for more details.

# config.xml _(generated)_

This file is generated from `resources/config/cordova/config.master.xml` when running the `gulp config` task. This is the main configuration file that Cordova uses to build and run your application.

!!! warn
	This file will be removed when executing the `gulp clean` or `gulp clean:config` tasks and should not be committed to source control.
