# Ionic/TypeScript Starter Project

Welcome to the documentation for the [Ionic/TypeScript Starter Project](https://github.com/Justin-Credible/Ionic-TypeScript-Starter).

## Overview

When the [Ionic Framework](http://ionicframework.com/) was released I knew it would make developing cross platform hybrid applications much easier than trying to cobble together my own framework. Its focus on looking and performing like a native app was icing on the cake.

Around the same time I discovered Ionic, I also learning [TypeScript](typescriptlang.org) for refactoring large enterprise applications. After seeing the power of TypeScript's code insight for rich IDE tooling and compile time checking, I never wanted to go back to vanilla JavaScript.

I had been wanted to get into mobile app development for a while, and Ionic and TypeScript, coupled with the free [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) IDE made this an attrictive solution for cross platform development.

## Getting Started

The starter project template targets iOS, Android, and Chrome (as an extension). Development can be done on Mac OS, Linux, or Windows with any IDE or your favorite text editor. I recommend using the free and lightweight [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) editor as it has superb support for TypeScript. This project also includes vscode task mappings to the various gulp tasks.

To begin, you can check out the [Features](features.md) page to get an idea for what is provided in the starter project.

Next, you can look at the [Getting Started](getting-started.md) for information on pre-requisites and instructions on how to setup your development environment.

Finally, dive into the rest of the documentation to see how things work. I recommend starting out getting familiar with the project layout and [Gulp Tasks](gulp-tasks.md).

## Why?

I put this starter project together as a result of looking for examples on how to use TypeScript with an Ionic/Angular application. There were several simple code snippets and examples out there, but nothing that showed how to structure an entire application.

In addition, most examples I found didn't really take full advantage of TypeScript in my opinion. I wanted to explore what a well structured mobile application could look like and avoid deeply nested annonymous JavaScript functions.

My goal is a clean and easy to read source structure that should be easy for anyone to get started with, even those without much Ionic or Angular experience.

## Framework vs Starter Project

My intention here is not to create a framework, but instead provide an example of how you can structure your Ionic application using TypeScript.

The distinction here is that you won't download a ZIP file or drop in a library to your application to use this project. Instead it is a reference or starting point for your own application.

While there is some framework-like functionality (base controller classes, dialog helpers, utility classes, etc) it is all optional and can be used at your own discretion. See [features](features.md) for more details on what is included.

Also, I encourage you to restructure the application to fit your needs. Don't like gulp? Switch to your favorite task runner. Don't like the directory layout? Move files around to suit your preference.
