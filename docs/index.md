# Ionic/TypeScript Starter Project

Welcome to the documentation for the [Ionic/TypeScript Starter Project](https://github.com/Justin-Credible/Ionic-TypeScript-Starter).

## Overview

When the [Ionic Framework](http://ionicframework.com/) was released, I knew it would make developing cross-platform hybrid applications much easier than a framework I cobbled together on my own. Its focus on looking and performing like a native app was the icing on the cake.

Around the same time that I discovered Ionic, I was also in the midst of learning [TypeScript](http://typescriptlang.org) for refactoring large enterprise applications. After seeing the power of TypeScript's code insight for rich IDE tooling and compile time checking, I never wanted to go back to vanilla JavaScript.

I had been wanting to get into mobile app development for a while, and Ionic and TypeScript, coupled with the free [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) IDE, made this an attractive solution for cross-platform development.

## Where to Start?

The starter project template targets iOS, Android, Chrome (as an extension), and can be served as a mobile website. Development can be done on Mac OS, Linux, or Windows with your favorite IDE or text editor. I recommend using the free and lightweight [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) editor, as it has superb support for TypeScript. This project also includes VS Code task mappings to the various gulp tasks.

To begin, take look at [Getting Started](getting-started.md) for information on prerequisites and instructions on how to set up your development environment.

Next, I recommend examining the project layout and [Gulp Tasks](gulp-tasks.md).

Finally, you can learn about the functionality included with the [Base Framework](base-framework.md) and get some [Development Tips](development-tips.md).

!!! note
	If you are developing on Windows or Linux and intend to create iOS builds, you'll want to check out [Running iOS Simulator Remotely](development-tips.md#running-ios-simulator-remotely) for more details on how to use a remote OS X machine to create your iOS builds.

## Why?

I put this starter project together after looking for examples of how to use TypeScript with an Ionic/Angular application. There were several simple code snippets and examples out there, but nothing that showed how to structure an entire mobile application.

Furthermore, most examples I found didn't really take full advantage of TypeScript. I wanted to explore what a well-structured mobile application could look like and to avoid the deeply nested anonymous JavaScript functions pattern I commonly ran across.

My goal was a clean, easy-to-read codebase intuitive for anyone to get started with, even those without much Ionic or Angular experience.

## "Framework" vs "Starter Project"

My intention with this is not to create a complete application framework, but instead to provide an example of how you can structure your Ionic application using TypeScript.

The distinction is that you won't download a ZIP file or drop a pre-built library into your application to use this project. Instead, this project is a reference or a starting point from which to build your own application.

While there is some framework-like functionality included (base controller classes, dialog helpers, utility classes, etc.), this is all optional, and can be used or omitted at your discretion. See [Base Framework](base-framework.md) for more details on what is included.

Also, I suggest restructuring the application to fit your needs. Don't like gulp? Switch to your favorite task runner. Don't like the directory layout? Move files around to suit your preference.
